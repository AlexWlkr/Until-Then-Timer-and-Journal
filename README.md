# Until Then Timer

**Until Then Timer** is a calming countdown timer and reflection journal built with vanilla JavaScript. It’s designed to support people through in-between moments — whether you're counting down to something exciting, managing uncertainty, or simply trying to slow down and stay present.

This is the second project in my frontend portfolio, where I focused on creating something minimal, supportive, and emotionally grounded.

### What It Does
- Set a custom countdown timer (e.g. 30 minutes, 2 hours, 3 days)
- Write reflections while the timer runs
- Each journal entry is timestamped and saved in the browser
- All data persists via local storage, even after refresh

### Why I Built This
This project gave me space to explore calm, reflection, and stillness in the digital experience. I wanted to design something minimal and emotionally grounding — a tool to help users move through waiting, uncertainty, or transitions without pressure to be productive.

It was also a chance to deepen my JavaScript skills, practice working with local storage, and design a soft, supportive interface from the ground up.

### Tech Stack
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Local storage to persist data
- Responsive design

### What’s Next
- Add optional sound or visual animations for a more sensory experience
- Let users export or save their journal entries
- Explore building a React or mobile-friendly version
- Add light/dark mode toggle

I’m Alex Walker — a digital strategist turned frontend developer with a master’s in clinical social work. My work blends code, community, and care. I’m currently completing Skillcrush’s frontend program and looking for a junior dev role on a mission-driven team.

Let’s build digital tools that help people feel more grounded, supported, and seen.

This project was built independently with support from ChatGPT as a learning and debugging tool. Every line of code was reviewed and customized as part of my frontend development practice.
