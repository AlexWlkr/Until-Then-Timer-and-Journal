# countdown-site
This is a small front-end web project built to help me stay motivated as I near the end of my full-time job and fully dedicate myself to coding.

#Project Purpose

This project displays a countdown timer to July 30, 2025 — my final day at work. Below the timer, there's a reflection area where I can journal my thoughts day by day. Each reflection is saved locally in the browser and timestamped.

This is a personal, beginner-friendly build designed to practice key web development skills while also serving as a motivational tool.

#Features

Live countdown timer that updates every second.

Reflection journaling area with textarea input and a submit button.

Reflections are saved to localStorage and persist across page reloads.

When the countdown reaches zero, a celebration message appears with visual effects (like CSS-only confetti).

#Built With

HTML5

CSS3 (with custom fonts and layout styling)

Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event listeners, localStorage, time/date calculations)

#How AI Helped

I built this project with significant support from ChatGPT. As I'm still in the learning phase of my journey, I asked ChatGPT to:

Explain concepts in beginner-friendly terms

Help debug my JavaScript errors

Walk me through layout adjustments in CSS

Provide structured practice, code reviews, and emotional encouragement

AI didn’t write this whole thing for me. I had to understand each line, integrate everything, and troubleshoot along the way. I took breaks, hit roadblocks, and learned to branch my code thanks to the mistakes I made.

This isn’t just a code demo — it’s a milestone.

#What I Learned

How to build a countdown using setInterval() and Date

Basic use of localStorage to save and retrieve data

Structuring HTML and CSS for layout consistency

Debugging JavaScript with console.log()

Using Git to manage commits, roll back changes, and restore working versions

That version control can be emotionally helpful too :)
